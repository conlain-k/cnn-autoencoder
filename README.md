# cnn-autoencoder
Simple test at a CNN-based autoencoder


NOTE: this repo was originally a demo for a colleague, but I since merged it into some instructional tutorials. For an updated version please find the [autoencoder notebook](https://github.com/conlain-k/neural_net_demo/blob/main/cnn/autoencoder.ipynb) in the new repo: https://github.com/conlain-k/neural_net_demo.
